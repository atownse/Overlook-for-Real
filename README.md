# Overlook Hotel Project

## Project Overview


----
In this project I made a hotel application that allowed users to book a room and see details about the occupation of this hotel.

The functionality of this app included a use for two types of users: a manager and a customer.
A manager is able to: 
- Observe the avilable rooms
- Book a room for whichever customer is asking
- Monitor the revenue for the day
- View the percentage of occupied rooms
- Remove a customer's booking
-Log out

A customer is able to:
- Look at rooms available to them and book one
- See what rooms are what type
- View their past visits
- See how much they have spent at this hotel
- Log out

## Goals

My goals for this project were to make a functioning site that used material learned throughout the second module of Turing FE classes. 
I wanted to successfully handle fetch requests on my own and practice more with the array iterator methods, TDD, and scss. I also gathered more practice using a project board and making issues.

## Technologies And Tools
Tools used included: js, html, scss, webpack, and github project board and issues


## Challenges

I am still trying to get better at styling and coming up with a clean and creative look but time constraints, the current politcal environment, and working to make things function properly were all ever present throughout this, so I did my best to work through these issues and try to create something successful.
